# Problem 5
"""
Take it further:
Many student use the command line as a game interface
(ie tic-tac-toe, battleship, hangman)

make a tic-tac-toe board using string characters and format 
#each of the nine squares with an integer in the middle using a 
string formatting technique

expected output:

   1   |  2   |  3   
---------------------
   4   |  5   |  6  
---------------------
    7  |  8   |  9
 
 Take it even further!!!:
 use variables assigned values from raw_input() to format each square's label  
 instead of numbers. adjust the spacing as necessary to keep the tic-tac-toe
 board shape
 
 goals: problem solving, string formatting, introduce projects types, introduce
 raw_input(), variables, multiple line strings
