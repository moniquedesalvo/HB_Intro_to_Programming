#print string formatting with the format() style
print '''Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as {}. 
And everywhere that {} went.'''.format('snow', 'mary') #replace <...> with string
print "The lamb was sure to go"

print "twinkle {} little {}".format('twinkle', 'star') #add missing the string values
print "how i wonder what you %s" % ('are') #add missing the string values

print "." * 10  # what'd that do?
